# Types of Testing

---
# What is unit testing?

* **Code** that tests a small piece of functionality
  * A unit is often a class or function
  * One unit can have multiple tests

--
* Test that it **does the right thing**, not how it does it
  * *contract*: input and output to the unit
  * Do *not* test how the work is performed

--
* Tests ensures that the **code meets expectations**
  * and continues to meet expectations over time
---
# Why unit test?

* Faster debugging
* Faster development
* Better design
* Detect regressions (when you introduce a bug)
* Reduce maintenance costs
* Provides a living documentation of the system
* Refactoring your code and know that you have not broken anything

---

# Why unit testing is not common

**I don't have time to write tests because I am too busy debugging**
--

* **Extra work**: Once I debug my code I have to write test code
  * Unit tests help you debug more quickly
  * Write tests as you write your code
--

* **I tested my code, it works**:
  * We manually test and throw the test away
  * We test, just not in a way that is reproducible
---

# Why unit testing is not common

* **Writing tests is slow**: 
  * Adding and removing print statements is slow
  * Manually retest, over and over again. This is very slow
--

* **I am too busy tracking down a bug**:
  * Future you does not test all aspects and bugs are created
  * Future bugs that are hard to track down.
--

* **Do not know how to unit test**: 
  * It is simple, I will show you.

# Introduction

* Developed by Hadley Wickham
* [testthat: Get Started with Testing](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/testthat.pdf)
    * The R Journal, vol. 3, no. 1, pp. 5–10, 2011
* Well integrated into RStudio and the tidyverse
---

# Hierarchical structure

The structure of tests are hierarchiral

* **Context**: group tests together by related functionality
* **Tests**: group expectations together
* **Expectations**: describe what the result of a computation should be
---

# Context

* Groups a set of tests that are related by a functionality
* Generally, one `context()` per test file
* Generally, you have one for each class or set of related functions

Command: `testthat::context(desc)`

Example: `testthat::context("Joining strings")`
---

# Tests

* Groups related expectations together
* Check variations of the expectation

Command: `testthat::test_that(desc, code)`
Example: 
```r
test_that("basic case works", {
  test <- c("a", "b", "c")

  expect_equal(str_c(test), test)
  expect_equal(str_c(test, sep = " "), test)
  expect_equal(str_c(test, collapse = ""), "abc")
})
```
---

# Expectations

* The heart of the system. Simple test of the expectations
* Describes the explicit result of a computation
  * does it have the right value, class, length, or throw an exception, warning, message
* starts with `expect_`
* There are two methods families of expectations
1. `expect_that()` - old school
1. `expect_CONDITION()` - new school. `CONDITION` is a label
---

# Expectation Families

* There are several families of expectations built around `expect_that`

## comparison

`expect_lt()`, `expect_lte()`, `expect_gt()`, `expect_gte()`

## Equality

`expect_equal()`, `expect_equivalent()`, `expect_identical()`
---

# Expectation Families

## Length

`expect_length()`

## RegEx matching

`expect_match()`

## Output

`expect_output()`, `expect_output_file()`, `expect_error()`, 
`expect_message()`, `expect_warning()`, `expect_silent()`
---

# Expectation Families

## Inheritance

`expect_null()`, `expect_type()`, `expect_is()`, `expect_s3_class()`,
`expect_s4_class()`

## Logical

`expect_true()`, `expect_false()`

## Reference file / object

`expect_equal_to_reference()`

---

# Expectation Families

## Expectations that will always fail or succeed

`fail()`, `succeed()`

## Check the names of an object

`expect_named()`
---


# Putting it all together

```r
context("Joining strings")

test_that("basic case works", {
  test <- c("a", "b", "c")

  expect_equal(str_c(test), test)
  expect_equal(str_c(test, sep = " "), test)
  expect_equal(str_c(test, collapse = ""), "abc")
  rm(test)
})

test_that("NULLs are dropped", {
  # more expectations
})
```
---

# Setup and Tear down
* `testthat` does not tear down your environment
* Do not change your environment!
* Setup and clean up your environment manually
  * Clean-up side-effects (writing a file, remove vars)

```r
test_that("basic case works", {
  test <- c("a", "b", "c")  # setup
  expect_equal(str_c(test), test) # expectation
  rm(test) # tear down
})
```
---

# Setup the testing environment

```r
usethis::use_test('my-test')

#> ✔ Adding 'testthat' to Suggests field in DESCRIPTION
#> ✔ Creating 'tests/testthat/'
#> ✔ Writing 'tests/testthat.R'
#> ✔ Writing 'tests/testthat/test-my-test.R'
```

* Test files are in `test/testthat/`
* filename must start with `test`
---

# Test Workflow Cycle
1. Write tests and code
  * `usethis::use_test()` creates a new test file
1. Running tests (choose one)
  * Ctrl/Cmd-shift-t
  * `devtools::test()`
  * `devtools::check()` runs tests and does other things
  * `R CMD check` 
1. Fix bugs
1. Repeat
---

# Test Output

* Number of passed, failed, warnings and skipped tests
* One line per context 
* Label is what you put in the context.

```r
Testing stringr
✔ | OK F W S | Context
✔ |  4       | case
✔ |  1       | conv
✔ |  4       | Counting matches
✖ | 34 1     | Replacements
```
---

# Failure message:

Error messages printed below the context.

One message for each error

```r
test-replace.r:7: failure: basic replacement works
str_replace("abababa", "ba", "BA") not equal to "aBAbabaBAD".
1/1 mismatches
x[1]: "aBAbaba"
y[1]: "aBAbabaBAD"
```
